# Paramula Project
Unfinished project.
Its purpose was to allow people, musician or not, to gather and to create an original piece of percussion music. Each player will create its own part in live, ruled by a priority queue system, and will overlap to other musician, to create percussion loops. Each of those loops will be recorded through piezo sensors, connected to an Arduino. Those records will be automatically transcripted to 'friendly-to-read' tabs, to allow players to play back what they have composed earlier. In the end, all those recorded tabs can be edited and merged together to get a full peace of music.
